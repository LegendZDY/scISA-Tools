# scIsoSeq-Analysis-Tools

High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful technique but only generates short reads from one end of a cDNA template, limiting the reconstruction of highly diverse isofrom. Recent technological advancements in high-throughput scRNA-Seq methods such Droplet-based single-cell sequencing allow thousands of cells to be captured and sequenced in a relatively short time frame and at a fraction of the cost. Such methods rely on capture of polyadenylated mRNA transcripts followed by cDNA synthesis, pooling, amplification, library construction, and short-read 3’ cDNA sequencing. The combination of fragmentation and short-read sequencing fails to sufficiently sequence the Alternative splicing transcripts. Consequently, 3’-tag scRNA-Seq platforms have limited application for determining clonotypic information from large numbers of lymphocytes. Recent advances in long-read sequencing technologies present a potential solution to the shortcomings of short-read sequencing. Full-length cDNA reads can encompass the entire sequence of BCR and TCR transcripts, but typically suffer from higher error rates and lower sequencing depth than short-read technologies.
